All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- All the archive's levels: L2A (`BASIC`) and L2B (`CALIBRATED`) bursts
  besides Ortho L3. `Query` describes a search (levels, release, `bbox` in
  degrees, `tile`, `relative_orbit`, `burst_cycle`, `swath`, `direction`,
  `product_type`); `query_body` builds it, padding the orbit to the three
  digits the archive requires.
- `EgmsArchive.find`: the files a query matches, latest sub-release of each;
  a box larger than the archive accepts (5° a side) is split by `split_bbox`
  and the results merged.
- `EgmsArchive.fetch`: downloads streamed to disk (`.part`, then renamed),
  in parallel with a limit, retried on network errors and 429/502/503/504,
  a search searched again when its id expires, files already on disk
  skipped, `keep` choosing the ZIP or its `tiff` / `csv` / `xml`, and
  `max_bytes` refusing a download before its first byte.
- `EgmsArchive.levels`, `.bursts`; `Hit` carries level, path, bbox and the
  burst fields.
- `ServiceKey.from_env` (`EGMS_SERVICE_KEY` or `EGMS_SERVICE_KEY_FILE`) and
  `ServiceKey.from_file`; `EgmsArchive()` with no arguments opens its own
  HTTP client and reads the key from the environment.
- `default_directory`: `EGMS_DATA_DIR`, else the user cache.
- `egms` command line: `releases`, `levels`, `search`, `download`.

### Changed

- `fetch_tile` streams the ZIP to disk instead of holding it in memory, and
  its `directory` is optional.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- `EgmsArchive.fetch_tile` refuses a hit whose file name does not belong to
  the requested tile or contains `/` (`EgmsError`), instead of saving it
  where the cache never finds it again.
- The cached sub-release is chosen by number (`_10` over `_9`), as
  `latest_hit` already did.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- `ServiceKey`, `assertion`, `token_request`, `parse_token`: bearer tokens
  from a CLMS service key (RS256 JWT bearer grant).
- `search_body` / `parse_search` / `latest_hit`, `parse_releases`,
  `download_url` / `check_download` / `extract_tiff`: Ortho L3 tiles, with
  sea tiles as `None` and refusals served as HTTP 200 as `EgmsError`.
- `EgmsArchive`: async client over an injected `httpx.AsyncClient`, with
  token renewal and an on-disk cache of tiles and absent tiles.
- `egms_client.mosaic` (extra `raster`): tiles pasted on one grid, CRS
  compared by parameters (`IGNF:ETRS89LAEA` tiles accepted).
- Extracted from Limen (`src/limen/integrations/egms/` at 9b977bb) and
  relicensed under Apache-2.0 by its sole author. New: file names come from
  the search hit, so sub-releases other than `_1` work.
